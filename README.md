# Getting Started with Kubernetes

## Deploy an Express.js Server with a Load Balancer

This repository contains all the necessary scripts and code to deploy an Express.js server on a Kubernetes cluster hosted on [Linode](https://cloud.linode.com/dashboard).

The app uses the Express framework to create a simple API server that interacts with the Ethereum blockchain. It utilizes the Web3.js library to fetch the balance of an Ethereum address using a [Chainstack](https://chainstack.com/) node.

The project aims to provide a comprehensive guide for beginners to get hands-on experience with Kubernetes deployments, pod management, and load balancing.

### Prerequisites

- Kubernetes CLIâ€” [Install kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- [Linode](https://cloud.linode.com/dashboard) Account
- [Chainstack](https://console.chainstack.com/user/account/create) account

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/soos3d/get-started-with-kubernetes.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```
   cd get-started-with-kubernetes
   ```

3. **Set KUBECONFIG Environment Variable**

   Deploy a kubernetes cluster on Linode and get the `kubeconfig.yaml` file, then add it to the project and run:

   ```
   export KUBECONFIG=kubeconfig.yaml
   ```

4. **Deploy the Pod**

   First deploy an Ethereum node on Chainstack:

   1. [Sign up with Chainstack](https://console.chainstack.com/user/account/create).
   1. [Deploy a node](https://docs.chainstack.com/platform/join-a-public-network).
   1. [View node access and credentials](https://docs.chainstack.com/platform/view-node-access-and-credentials).

   Use the node RPC URL as environment variable.

   ```
   kubectl run addressbalance --image=soos3d/addressbalance:latest --port=80 --env="ETHEREUM_RPC_URL=YOUR_CHAINSTACK_NODE_URL" --env="PORT=3333"
   ```

   This will deply one pod manually.

5. **Deploy Using Manifest**

   > Find the manifest in the `k8s` directory.

   Add the Chainstack RPC node to the environment variables.

   ```yaml
   env:
     - name: ETHEREUM_RPC_URL
       value: "YOUR_CHAINSTACK_RPC_URL"
     - name: PORT
       value: "3333"
   ```

   Then run:

   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f server_deployment.yaml
   ```

   This will deploy 4 managed pods.

6. **Set Up Load Balancer**

   > Find the manifest in the `k8s` directory.

   ```
   kubectl apply -f server_loadbalance.yaml
   ```
